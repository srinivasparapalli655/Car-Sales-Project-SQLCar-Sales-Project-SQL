# Car-Sales-Project-SQLCar-Sales-Project-SQL
🚗 Car Sales & Inventory Management SystemA robust SQL-based solution for managing a car dealership's operations. This project includes a normalized database schema and a suite of analytical queries to monitor sales performance, inventory status, and customer trends for the year 2025.
📊 Database ArchitectureThe carsalesdb consists of three primary tables with enforced referential integrity:1. CarsMaintains the dealership's inventory.Attributes: Brand, Model, Year (2000+), Color, Engine Type (Petrol, Diesel, Electric, Hybrid), Transmission, Price, and Stock Status.2. CustomersStores demographic information for CRM purposes.Attributes: Name, Gender, Age, Phone, Email, and City.3. SalesRecords every transaction, linking customers to specific vehicles.Attributes: Sale Date, Quantity, Sale Price, Payment Method (Cash, Credit, Installment), and Salesperson.
🚀 Key Business QueriesThe project includes pre-configured SQL scripts to extract the following insights:
📈 Sales PerformanceRevenue by Brand: Identifies which car brands generate the highest total revenue.Salesperson Leaderboard: Tracks individual performance, filtering for staff with more than 3 successful sales or those moving more than 5 units in 2025.High-Value Markets: Analyzes the average sale price across different cities to identify premium markets.
🚘 Inventory & Technical AnalysisPremium Stock: Filters available cars priced above $50,000.Technical Specs: Searches for specific configurations, such as "Automatic Petrol" vehicles.Pricing Trends: Calculates the average price per engine type (e.g., comparing Electric vs. Diesel).
👥 Customer InsightsDemographic Targeting: Filters customers over age 30 living in specific cities (e.g., cities starting with "New").Loyalty Tracking: Identifies "Power Buyers" who have purchased more than 2 vehicles.Geography: Lists all unique cities where active sales have occurred via table joins.
🛠️ Technical ImplementationData Integrity: Uses CHECK constraints to ensure realistic data (e.g., years $\ge$ 2000, prices $>$ 0, and valid age ranges).Relational Mapping: Implements INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN to connect sales data with customer and vehicle details.Advanced Filtering: Utilizes GROUP BY and HAVING clauses to perform complex data aggregations.
